# SubwayMap_Visualization
This program manages adding and deleting subway stations and relevant connections. It also shows direct distance between two stations in terms of stations in between with the help of breadth-first search algorithm. The program also uses the depth-first search algorithm to show the critical points in the subway map. This program aims to show important stations in the subway system. It can also be used to make transit efficient by calculating the direct distance between stations.

## Installation:

1. Fork/Clone this project
2. Run on any c# compiler preferably visual studio.

## Running the Program:
1. Initially the subway map is prepopulated with some stations and connections.
2. The terminal will now display the list of commands to perform a list of actions.
